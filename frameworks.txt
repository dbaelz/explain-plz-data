Contains the main Android Framework. This consists of all the API a developer
can use, when coding against Android Apps, several system services and native 
daemons, the Android Runtime and so on. It is the framework running on top of 
the Linux kernel on an Android device, making Android what it is. Though you 
could also say the default apps and packages belong to the framework, this 
folder contains mainly the core framework, services, etc.
